# Publishing multiple schedule records

Flylogs schedule records have varying statuses. By default, when you create a new schedule record, it will be set to "Scheduled" but remain unpublished. Only you and other company managers will have access to the schedule records you've just created.

This default behavior is designed for complex schedules where multiple changes may occur to each record before the final schedule is ready. You have the option to control this behavior when creating each schedule record by enabling or disabling the "**Publish Immediately**" checkbox in the schedule record editing window. By default, for new records, this option will be disabled.

If you create a complete schedule without publishing each record at the moment of creation, you will end up with a large number of scheduled flights that remain unpublished. Consequently, only you and company managers will have visibility of them.
