# Publishing multiple schedule records

Flylogs schedule records have different status, by default, as you create each schedule record, it will be Scheduled, but unpublished. Only you and other company managers will be able to see this schedule records you just created. \
This behavior is intended for complex schedules where several changes can take place to each record before the final schedule is ready.

You can manage this behaviour when creating each schedule record by activating or deactivating the **Publish Immediately** checkbox on the schedule record edit window. By default, for new records, it will be deactivated.

The result of creating a full schedule without publishing each record at the moment of creating it, is that   you will have a big amount of scheduled flights that are not published, hence only you and company managers can see them.
