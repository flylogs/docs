# Publishing multiple schedule records

After creating a full schedule, maybe for a whole week, you can publish them in a single action. This action is aimed for complex schedules where several changes can be anticipated to each record before the final schedule is ready.

To do so, just create your schedule records as needed without making them public, do no click the Publish Immediately checkbox on the schedule record edit window.

The result, is when finished, you will have a big amount of scheduled flights that are not published, hence only you and company managers can see these.

The unpublished scheduled flights will appear in your schedule review window with a black eye indication.
