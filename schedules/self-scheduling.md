# Self scheduling

Flylogs allows you to setup auto scheduling with restrictions for your pilots.

You can choose, who can use the auto schedule, which aircraft and some extra conditions, like minimun booking time and requirement for a FI or not.

### Initial setup

In your company settings page, you will find the general Schedule settings. You can here set settings that will apply to all schedules and all users.&#x20;

You can choose how much time before the flight you allow your pilots to cancel a schedule, and the following checkboxes allows you to choose whether you require PIC and SIC to confirm the scheduled flight.

[In the second part of this settings box, you can limit the self scheduling options. ](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that self scheduling has to be enabled on each aircraft!
{% endhint %}

You can choose whether you want to **block night time reservations** or **pilots with no remaining billing credit**.\
You can also choose the maximum number of reservations per day and min/max slot times.

#### Aircraft setup for Self Scheduling

You need to activate self scheduling on each aircraft.

On the aircraft settings page, you will find the Enable Self-Scheduling option along with the option to limit which pilots can fly this particular plane.

On the same aircraft edit page you can find the **Qualified pilots** list, where you can select which pilots are able to self-schedule on the aircraft. If no pilots are entered, the system understands that any pilot can fly the aircraft as PIC.



### Flight self-booking for pilots

As a pilot, on my dashboard, I can find a **Schedule a flight** box, see below:

When accesing the scheduling tool, the pilot will be able to see all aircraft for which he or she is authorized as PIC to rent. The calendar displays other flights blocking the calendar slots and the pilot only has to click and drag on the desired time slot.

Once the pilot clicks and holds on a time slot, the system will automatically pop up the booking confirmation window that you can see in the following screenshot:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 11.26.48.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Self-booking modal window</p></figcaption></figure>

The self-booking modal that you see above, has a different behavior depending on the pilot profile making the appointment. Students will have to select a PIC, while pilots, Flight instructors and higher ranks can select themselves as PIC or leave the field empty.

Once the pilot clicks on the **Book this Slot** button, the system locks the slot and notifies the PIC requesting confirmation. Once the PIC confirmes the flight, the SIC will not be able to change the booking.

[^1]: \- Remember that to give your pilots the option to self schedule a flight, you also have to enable this on each one of your aircraft. -&#x20;
