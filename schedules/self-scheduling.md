# Self scheduling

Flylogs allows you to setup auto scheduling with restrictions for your pilots.

You can choose, who can use the auto schedule, which aircraft and some extra conditions, like minimun booking time and requirement for a FI or not.

### Initial setup

The setup is performed on each aircraft. On the aircraft settings page, you will find the Enable Self-Scheduling option.

On the same aircraft edit page you can find the **Qualified pilots** list, where you can select which pilots are able to self-schedule on the aircraft. If no pilots are entered, the system understands that any pilot can fly the aircraft as PIC.



### Usage as a pilot

As a pilot, on my dashboard, I can find a **Schedule a flight** box, see below:

When accesing the scheduling tool, the pilot will be able to see all aircraft for which he or she is authorized as PIC to rent. The calendar displays other flights blocking the calendar slots and the pilot only has to click and drag on the desired time slot.

Once the pilot clicks and holds on a time slot, the system will automatically pop up the booking confirmation window to select the type of flight and a Flight Instructor if required.

Once the pilot clicks on the Book this Slot button, the system locks the slot and notifies with an email to the pilot and also the company managers.
