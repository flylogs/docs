# Using the Flight Dispatch Function

The **Flight Dispatch** feature allows operations staff to provide pilots with all necessary operational details before a flight.\
When a flight is dispatched, the system automatically creates a **Flight Draft** with the additional information entered, ensuring pilots have clear, accurate, and standardized pre-flight data.

This article explains how the feature works, what each screen shows, and how the information flows into the pilot-visible flight draft.

### **1. Opening the Dispatch Menu**

From the **Schedule** view, locate the flight you want to dispatch.\
Click the **SCHEDULED** button to open the actions dropdown.

In the dropdown, select **Dispatch Flight**.\
This opens the _Create Flight Draft_ window.

### **2. Creating the Flight Draft**

The **Create Flight Draft** pop-up allows you to specify operational details needed by pilots.\
These fields may include:

* **Departure and Arrival airports**
* **Callsign**
* **Flight type** (e.g., Commercial, Dual, etc.)
* **Passenger count**
* **Cargo weight**
* **Route**
* **Remarks** (e.g., special cargo, restrictions, operational notes)

Once all required fields are completed, click **Create Draft**.\
The system will generate a flight draft visible to the pilots assigned to the flight.

### **3. How the Flight Draft Appears to Pilots**

Once created, the draft becomes available in the pilot interface.\
All information entered during dispatch is automatically inserted into the draft, ensuring the flight crew receives clear and complete data.

The pilot view includes:

* Flight type
* Distance and number of landings
* Cross-country status
* Passengers & cargo
* Route
* A dedicated **Remarks** section containing any operational notes added during dispatch

This ensures pilots can review all important details immediately, without needing additional communication from operations.

### **Summary**

The **Flight Dispatch** function streamlines communication between operations and flight crew by:

* Allowing dispatchers to add all relevant pre-flight information
* Automatically populating the pilot’s flight draft
* Reducing manual updates and potential communication delays
* Ensuring a standardized workflow for all flights

By using this feature for every dispatched flight, your team improves accuracy, operational clarity, and overall efficiency.
