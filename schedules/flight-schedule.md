# Flight Schedule

The flight schedule calendar view, is an overall view available for managers in which all schedulled flights appear.\


**This view, has 3 modes:**

* Daily view
* Week view
* Month view



Each mode has its benefits, but in all of them, we have a legend to understand the status of each flight.

**Green Border:** Flight is scheduled and confirmed.

**Black Border:** Flight is cancelled.

**Red Border:** Flight is not confirmed by one or more members of the crew.



Additionally, the member that has not confirmed the flight will appear boxed, and the member who cancelled will appear crossed with a line through the text.

Week view is better suited for larger operators where tight scheduling of large fleets is a key factor of the operation.

In this case, the user can scroll horizontally throughout the whole week.

This view enables easy view of night flights because of the continuous scrolling through the week.

### Month view

Month view is a simple month calendar. Good for very small operators with one or two aircraft and not too many flights.

It allows easy view of the scheduled flights for a whole month.
