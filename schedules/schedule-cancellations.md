# Schedule cancellations

Flight cancellations are something we can not avoid. The important thing about them, is to keep a good track to analyze the factors and avoid the unnecessary events due to a lack of information about our own operations.

Flylogs is all about empowering you, the company manager, by giving you access to all the information in an easy to access and understand format.



Each scheduled flight, if confirmed by the pilots, is due to happen. Flylogs will understand that scheduled flights are happening and all non performed flights in the schedule will be counted as cancelled and attributed to the PIC.

The PIC, has the option to cancel the flight manually. By doing so, the system has the chance to ask for the reason.

This information is stored and displayed in the Schedule cancellation analytics page so you can have a better understanding of why your flights are being cancelled.
