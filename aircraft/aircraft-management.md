# Aircraft management

Adding aircraft to your account should be one of the first steps in the initial setup process to start working with Flylogs. Once you have aircraft and pilots, all features can be fully tested.

The aircraft management can only be performed by the account administrator or a designated Operations Manager that the company administrator can create.

Remember, you have no limits on the amount of users you create, but choose carefully the profile type, since each user group, has different access levels and permissions to edit and manage resources in your account.

View account limitations [here](../company-management/account-limitations.md).
