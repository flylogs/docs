# Aircraft maintenance

[Flylogs](https://www.flylogs.com/) provides you with a straightforward tool to store information on any past or future maintenance jobs that affect your aircraft. This tool enables better communication throughout your company and improves situational awareness for your crew, flight scheduling, and aircraft mechanics.&#x20;

Future maintenance windows will automatically block the scheduling agenda of the plane, and after the maintenance is performed and the **CRS** maintenance record is signed, the information will remain stored in the aircraft maintenance logs for ever.



### Maintenance edit form

If we had this maintenance previously planned, we will not need to create a new one.

Open the maintenance, or create a new one, and enter the data of the job.

**Make sure you specify correctly this 4 key elements:**

* Start and Finish date time of the job
* Maintenance descriptive job name
* Airframe hours at the time of the job is done
* Validity flight hours\


\


Finally, on the Botton, highlighted in yellow, the CRS signed box is what will validate the job and mark it as DONE. So do not forget to check the box.

### Maintenance validity tracker

Once a maintenance is performed and the CRS is signed, Flylogs will keep track of the aircraft flight time available for the next maintenance window.

**Flylogs will SUM the airframe hours of the last CRS with the entered validity flight hours.**



From the previous example, the aircraft airframe was at **84:39** and the validity are **50 hours**.

So the aircraft will have potential to fly until **134:39 hours, that is the moment Flylogs expects the next maintenance**.\


Flylogs displays you this information in your aircraft page and also in your manager home page with a gauge graph:
