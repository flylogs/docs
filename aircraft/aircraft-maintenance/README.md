# Aircraft maintenance

[Flylogs](https://www.flylogs.com/) gives you a very straight forward tool to store any past or future maintenance jobs affecting your aircraft.

This tool enables you better information communication through your company and better situational awareness for your crew, your flight scheduling and your aircraft mechanics.

***

Once an aircraft maintenance is performed and the CSR is signed, we can store this information in the aircraft maintenance books.

Flylogs allows you to not only store this information, but also set future alerts and share this information with the relevant people across your company.

### Maintenance edit form

If we had this maintenance previously planned, we will not need to create a new one.

Open the maintenance, or create a new one, and enter the data of the job.

**Make sure you specify correctly this 4 key elements:**

* Start and Finish date time of the job
* Maintenance descriptive job name
* Airframe hours at the time of the job is done
* Validity flight hours\


\


Finally, on the Botton, highlighted in yellow, the CRS signed box is what will validate the job and mark it as DONE. So do not forget to check the box.

### Maintenance validity tracker

Once a maintenance is performed and the CRS is signed, Flylogs will keep track of the aircraft flight time available for the next maintenance window.

**Flylogs will SUM the airframe hours of the last CRS with the entered validity flight hours.**



From the previous example, the aircraft airframe was at **84:39** and the validity are **50 hours**.

So the aircraft will have potential to fly until **134:39 hours, that is the moment Flylogs expects the next maintenance**.\


Flylogs displays you this information in your aircraft page and also in your manager home page with a gauge graph:
