**UTC vs local time.**

The timezone is a setting that the company management can set in the company settings page and affects all time fields across the different Flylogs systems, like Flights, schedules, trainings ...



To view the required timezone in the flight create form, put your mouse pointer on top of the time inputs and the tooltip will display the required timezone.
