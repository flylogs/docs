# User Login

### Congratulations and welcome to Flylogs - the General Aviation Cloud!

In order to start using Flylogs, your company must create an account for you. Users will be invited to join Flylogs by the company manager.

#### Welcome Email

Your company manager, will create an account for you with your email address. You will then receive an email from atc@flylogs.com with instructions to finish your profile setup.

> It is mandatory that you confirm your email address by clicking on the link that you will receive via email.

**Once you click on the confirmation link, you will be prompted to set your personal password and you are ready to fly!**

If you did not receive the confirmation email, check your spam folder for emails from atc@flylogs.com. Otherwise, contact your company manager or CTKI; or follow the Forgot password procedure described below.

***

### Forgotten password

If you forget your password, go to the login page and on the lower part of the white box, click the link: [Recover my password](https://www.flylogs.com/users/password\_recover/)

Enter your email address, and you will receive a password recovery email.

In case you do not receive the email, check that you entered the correct email address. Take a look at your SPAM folder and as a last option, contact your company manager or CTKI for help and guidance.





### Email validation

Company management accounts need to have an email address.

FI, pilot or mechanic accounts do not have this requirement.

When a new email is entered for a new or an existing user, the system requires the email address to be confirmed.

The confirmation is process is the same used in the sign up process. Just click on the received email with a confirmation link.

**Only confirmed email addresses will be able to login and receive emails from Flylogs.**\


#### Email bounces and complaints

If an email address bounces an email, the associated user account will be automatically set back to **NOT CONFIRMED**. If an account is marked as NOT CONFIRMED, the user must confirm the email address again the next time the user tries to log in.

If the bounces persist, the email address will be completely removed from FLYLOGS, leaving the account without email address and as a result, without option to log in.\


If we receive a complaint for a given email address, Flylogs will automatically remove all notification options for that user account to avoid sending any non-essential emails to that email address.
