# How to login

### Congratulations and Welcome to the Flylogs, the General Aviation Cloud.

In order to start using Flylogs, your company must create an account for you.

**Pilots can not create an account on their own.**

#### Welcome email

Your company manager, will need your email address to create your account.\


When that happens, you will receive an email from atc@flylogs.com with instructions to finish the setup process.

> It is mandatory that you confirm your email address by clicking on the link that you will receive on your Inbox.

**Once you click on the confirmation link, you will be asked to set your personal password and you are ready!**

If for any reason, you did not receive the confirmation email, first check your spam folder. If you do not see any emails from atc@flylogs.com, get in contact with Aerolink CTKI or follow the Forgotten password procedure described below.

***

### Forgotten password

If for any reason your password does not work anymore, go to the login page and on the lower part of the white box, click the link that says: [Recover my password](https://www.flylogs.com/users/password\_recover/)

Enter your email address, and you will receive a password recovery email.

Again, if you do not receive the email, check that you entered the correct email address. Take a look at your SPAM folder and last, get in contact with Aerolink CTKI for help and guidance.
