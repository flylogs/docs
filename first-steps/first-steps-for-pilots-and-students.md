90 days before any of your Certificates expires, Flylogs will email you a reminder to renew it and publish it to Flylogs.

If any of your required certificates expires, like for example the medical certificate, you will NOT be scheduled for flight.

### Schedule

Schedule management, your flight availability and your future flights will appear here.

Make sure to publish your flight availability at least one week in advance.&#x20;

If you do not publish your flight availability at the beginning of the previous week, you cannot expect to be scheduled for flight.

> Note that all flight schedule records are stored with a time stamp, so the roster manager knows when you published your availability.

To do so, click the PUBLISH AVAILABILITY button you will see on the top right corner

You can publish availability from week to week, or if you feel like it, you can publish for as many days in the future as you wish.
