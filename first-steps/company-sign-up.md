# Company Sign Up

If you need to manage crew, aircrafts or flights, you can start using Flylogs and streamline your operations quickly. Creating an account in Flylogs and start using the system is a 5 minute process that you will read about here:

{% hint style="info" %}
You should only create a new Flylogs account if you own or work in an aviation company at the management level. You will need a corporate email address with **@aviationcompanyname.tld**.

Otherwise, Flylogs may block your account temporarily until we manually verify you are a legitimate and authorized company representative.
{% endhint %}
