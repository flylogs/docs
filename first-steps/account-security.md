# Account security

Keeping a complex enough password, regularly updated sometimes could not be enought to maintain login credentials secure. Nowadays hacking methods are getting more sophisticated and so the security measures must.

Flylogs allows you to easily update your password from your user settings page, you can do so as often as you'd like. We encourage you to do so at least once a year.

On top of that, as an extra safety measure, upon every login from a different IP address, or every 7 days from the same address, Flylogs will send you a security code to your email address to be entered upon login.

This email code validation is a Second security measure, a 2FA called in the IT industry.

Please note:

* **2FA is mandatory for all company managers** to enhance account protection.
* For all other users, **2FA remains optional but strongly recommended** as an extra layer of security.

If receiving an email is not convenient for you, we also provide Google authentication. This method, still requires you to enter a 6 digit code upon user validation, but the code is provided by the Google Authenticator App instead of an emal address.
