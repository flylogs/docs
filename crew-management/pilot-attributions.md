# Pilot Attributions

The Pilot Attributions system in Flylogs is designed to enhance flight scheduling accuracy and compliance by ensuring that pilots are only assigned to aircraft and flight types for which they are authorized. This feature helps both company management and flight training departments maintain strict control over pilot qualifications, preventing scheduling errors that could lead to operational inefficiencies or regulatory non-compliance.

By setting attributions for each pilot, Flylogs ensures that no Pilot in Command (PIC) is scheduled for an aircraft or flight type outside their approved list. While this restriction primarily applies to PICs, Flylogs also provides warnings when a Second in Command (SIC) is assigned to an aircraft or flight type they are not qualified for.

Administrators can assign aircraft and flight type permissions directly in each pilot’s profile using the Attributions tab. To view a pilot's attributions, simply navigate to their profile and select this tab. If no attributions are set (the default behavior), Flylogs will not impose any restrictions on the pilot’s flight assignments.

### By leveraging Pilot Attributions, companies can maintain a high level of operational control, reduce scheduling errors, and ensure compliance with training and certification requirements.

When a pilot creates a flight, Flylogs automatically checks the attributions of the designated Pilot in Command (PIC). The system will limit the available options in the aircraft and flight type drop-down menus to only those that the pilot is approved to operate. This prevents unauthorized selections and streamlines the flight planning process.
