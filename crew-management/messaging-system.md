# Messaging System

Flylogs includes an internal messaging System. This, allows you to send notifications internally to any of your users in a secure and ordered manner.

The messaging system allows you to send messages for pilot groups, training groups or user groups.

If a message is marked as urgent and the recipient did not enter Flylogs to read the message, an automatic email alert will be delivered to the recipients email address within 24 hours.

If there are any undead messages, you will see a RED number on the top right corner showing the amount of unread messages waiting for you. Clicking on the number, shows a quick preview of the messages and the option to navigate to your inbox.
