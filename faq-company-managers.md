# FAQ company managers



**Q: Why can't I add or activate more aircraft in my account?**

**A:** If you've reached the maximum number of active aircraft allowed by your subscription plan, you won't be able to add new aircraft or activate deactivated ones. To proceed, you'll need to either deactivate an existing active aircraft or upgrade your subscription to a higher plan that supports more active aircraft.



**Q: Why is the maintenance counter graph not showing for an aircraft?**

**A:** The maintenance counter graph will only appear after the Certificate of Release to Service (CRS) has been marked as signed and the new potential (airframe hours and/or cycles) has been entered for the aircraft. This ensures that the system can accurately track maintenance intervals based on updated data.



**Q: How can I import multiple pilots into the system?**

**A:** You can easily import pilots from the **Pilots** menu using the **Import** option. This feature allows you to create a batch of pilot user accounts with the desired user level. You can also choose whether or not to send them invitations to join the system during the import process.



**Q: Can I restrict a pilot from being scheduled if they’re missing required certificates?**

**A:** Yes. You can configure pilot restrictions based on required certificates such as licenses, medical certificates, or ratings. The system will automatically prevent scheduling if any of these documents are missing or have expired, ensuring that only fully compliant pilots can be assigned to flights.



**Q: How can I restrict the types of aircraft or flights a pilot is allowed to operate?**

**A:** You can set limitations by assigning _pilot attributions_ from the pilot’s edit page. These attributions define which aircraft types and flight types the pilot is qualified for. When set, the system will prevent the scheduling or creation of flights that don't match the pilot’s qualifications, helping roster managers avoid assigning incorrect aircraft or flight types.



**Q: Can I import flight records directly into Flylogs?**

**A:** Direct flight imports are not currently available through the website due to the wide variety of logbook formats and the need to have pilots and aircraft already set up for each flight entry. However, our team is happy to assist you with this process—we’ve successfully completed many custom imports for our clients. Just reach out to us, and we’ll help you get it done.



**Q: How can I see which pilots are available for scheduling?**

**A:** You can view pilot availability in two ways:

1. From the **Availabilities** section, where you'll find a detailed report of users available for selected dates and times.
2. While **creating a flight** in the schedule, the system will highlight available pilots in **green**, and unavailable or busy pilots in **red**.

Additionally, Flylogs can suggest suitable pilots based on availability, qualification restrictions, and preferred pairings—helping you make smarter scheduling decisions.



**Q: Why can't I invite a pilot to an on-site training class?**

**A:** Before you can invite a pilot to an on-site training session, the pilot must first be enrolled as a student in that training course. Once enrolled, you'll be able to assign them to a specific class.



**Q: My instructors or pilots can not edit a flight.**

There are three possible reasons why this issue may be occurring:

1. **Company Settings Restrictions**\
   Your company settings may limit which user profiles have permission to create, edit, or delete flights. You can review these permissions in the company settings section.
2. **Logbook Modification Lock**\
   If the “Prevent logbook modification” option is enabled, users without management privileges will be unable to modify flights after a specified number of hours have passed since their creation.
3. **Deactivated Aircraft**\
   When an aircraft is deactivated, all associated flights become non-editable. To make changes to these flights, you must first reactivate the aircraft.
