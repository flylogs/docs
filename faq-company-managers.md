# FAQ company managers

**Q: My instructors or pilots can not edit a flight.**

There are three possible reasons why this issue may be occurring:

1. **Company Settings Restrictions**\
   Your company settings may limit which user profiles have permission to create, edit, or delete flights. You can review these permissions in the company settings section.
2. **Logbook Modification Lock**\
   If the “Prevent logbook modification” option is enabled, users without management privileges will be unable to modify flights after a specified number of hours have passed since their creation.
3. **Deactivated Aircraft**\
   When an aircraft is deactivated, all associated flights become non-editable. To make changes to these flights, you must first reactivate the aircraft.



**Q: Why can't I add or activate more aircraft in my account?**

**A:** If you've reached the maximum number of active aircraft allowed by your subscription plan, you won't be able to add new aircraft or activate deactivated ones. To proceed, you'll need to either deactivate an existing active aircraft or upgrade your subscription to a higher plan that supports more active aircraft.



**Q: Why can't I invite a pilot to an on-site training class?**

**A:** Before you can invite a pilot to an on-site training session, the pilot must first be enrolled as a student in that training course. Once enrolled, you'll be able to assign them to a specific class.
