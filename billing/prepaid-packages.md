# Prepaid packages

Once you have created your [billing rates](billing-rates.md) and packages, you can easily attach new package purchases to your pilots or customers.

In each pilot profile page, within the billing tab, you will find a Prepaid package box.

Here, you will be able to add new packages to the pilot, and view the existing ones.

To view the details of any package, just click on the name, and a new window will open with the package purchase details, as well as, the expenses billed with this package.

Every time that a [flight is automatically billed](automatic-flight-billing.md), Flylogs will first check if the pilot has a valid package for that type of flight and aircraft. If so, the bill will be first deducted from valid packages, and if no enought credit available, the outstanding balance will be removed from the pilotÂ´s balance.
