# Prepaid packages

Once you have created your [billing rates](billing-rates.md) and packages, you can easily attach new package purchases to your pilots or customers.

In each pilot profile page, within the billing tab, you will find a Prepaid package box.

Here, you will be able to add new packages to the pilot, and view the existing ones.

To view the details of any package, just click on the name, and a new window will open with the package purchase details, as well as, the expenses billed with this package.

Every time that a [flight is automatically billed](automatic-flight-billing.md), Flylogs will first check if the pilot has a valid package for that type of flight and aircraft. If so, the bill will be first deducted from valid packages, and if no enought credit available, the outstanding balance will be removed from the pilotÂ´s balance.

### Automatic Invoice generation

When billing a flight, manually or automatically an automatic invoice is generated. When prepaid packages this also applies.\
Flylogs generates an invoice for the total amount of the flight after deducting the amount from the package. If the total amount was paid using a package, then the invoice will be paid in full, but there can be times, when you client does not have enough balance left on a package. In this cases, the invoice will have the amount left to paid remaining and will not be marked as paid.

### Customizing the paying customer

A flight can be paid by someone else other than the crew. Flylogs allows you to charge the flight expenses to third party, both using prepaid packages or due balance to a client's account.\
The only limitation, is that the bill and the payment using packages has to be the same client. So you can not have half a flight paid with a package by client A, and the owed balance paid by a second client B.
