# Prepaid packages

Once you have created your [billing rates](billing-rates.md) and packages, you can easily attach new package purchases to your pilots or customers.

In each pilot profile page, within the billing tab, you will find a Prepaid package box.

Here, you will be able to add new packages to the pilot, and view the existing ones.

To view the details of any package, just click on the name, and a new window will open with the package purchase details, as well as, the expenses billed with this package.

Every time that a [flight is automatically billed](billing-setup.md), Flylogs will first check if the pilot has a valid package for that type of flight and aircraft. If so, the bill will be first deducted from valid packages, and if no enought credit available, the outstanding balance will be removed from the pilot´s balance.

### Automatic Invoice generation

When a new bill is created, an automatic invoice is generated.\
Flylogs generates an invoice that includes your company details and logo, as well as the customers information.

The receipt will have a consecutive number starting from 1 on every January 1st.

On the bottom part of the receipt, you will find the tax included if any, and the usage of the Prepaid packages.

### Customizing the paying customer

A flight can be paid by someone else other than the crew. Flylogs allows you to charge the flight expenses to third party, both using prepaid packages or due balance to a client's account.\
The only limitation, is that the bill and the payment using packages has to be the same client. So you can not have half a flight paid with a package by client A, and the owed balance paid by a second client B.
