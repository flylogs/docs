# Online payments

On top of having your full pilot billing automated in Flylogs, you can now also automate the payment process directly into your Stripe account.

Stripe is a payment processing platform that allows businesses to accept payments from their customers online. It's a popular payment gateway that is used by many companies around the world because it provides a secure and reliable way to accept online payments.

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">One of the key benefits of using Stripe is that it allows Flylogs operators to easily accept payments from their customers or pilots for outstanding amounts that are owed.</mark>

### Initial Configuration

In order to enable the safe communication between your Flylogs and Stripe accounts, you need to perform a very simple setup. Follow these steps in order:

1. Create a Stripe account for your company.
2. Configure your bank account and automatic payout method in Stripe.
3. Get the publishable\_key and the private\_key from your [Stripe LIVE Keys page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).
4. Enable the Stripe payments in your [Billing Settings page](https://www.flylogs.com/manager/companies/billing) and copy both keys before clicking on Save.

After completing those four easy steps, your pilots will have the option to make online payments that will be deposited directly into your Stripe account. If the payment is successful, the pilot's balance in Flylogs will be automatically updated.
