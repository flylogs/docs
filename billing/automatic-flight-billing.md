# Automatic flight billing

Flylogs is designed to make your flight data management fast and efficient.

One way we achieve this, is by storing all your flying club process data in a single place. This information availability, allows us to create automatic processes that until now, required much more of your time to complete.

#### Setup your aircraft for automatic billing

First thing, you will need to specify which aircraft you want to have automatic billing. Among this, you will also have to first configure the following:

* Flight billing
* Aircraft rental rates
* Billing criteria
* Automatic billing

Automatic billing happens 5 minutes after the flight was confirmed

In less than 5 minutes after the flight was confirmed and entered into pilot's and aircraft's logbooks, the bill is created.

The bill will be issued to the SIC by default, if no SIC is present in the flight, the bill will be issued to the PIC.

Flylogs will automatically multiply the flight/bock or tach time by the first rate that you specify in the aircraft configuration.

The bill will appear in your flight billing list and also in the flight it self.

This bill can be still edited or deleted if needed by you or any other billing manager you may have created.
