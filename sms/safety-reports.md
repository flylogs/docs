# Safety Reports

Flylogs SMS, is an integrated Safety Management System based on the [ICAO recommendations](https://www.unitingaviation.com/publications/safetymanagementimplementation/content/#/) fully compliant with the [ICAO Doc 9859](https://www.icao.int/safety/safetymanagement/pages/guidancematerial.aspx). It allows to receive safety events directly in your Flylogs account linked with all the relevant information like flight crew, aircraft, maintenance, flight crew, trainings, duty times, etc.

**Any member** of your organization **has the ability to** access the Safety Reporting System and **create a new report.**

These reports can be specifically related to a flight, or not, allowing any of your users to inform about more other types of risks.\


The safety manager and other company managers can see the whole list of events and access to the statistics.\
They can also request third parties to complete a report on an existing event, giving you more information of the a single event.

Related events will appear grouped together and will share some common details like date, location, type of event, etc.
