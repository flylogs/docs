# Safety Reports

[Our SMS](https://www.flylogs.com/features/safety-management) system allows to receive safety events, related to your flights, or independent of any flight.

**Any member** of your organization **has the ability to** access the Safety Reporting System and **create a new report.**

These reports can be specifically related to a flight, or not, allowing any of your users to inform about more other types of risks.\


The safety manager and other company managers can see the whole list of events and access to the statistics.

They can also request third parties to complete a report on an existing event, giving you more information of the a single event.

Related events will appear grouped together and will share some common details like date, location, type of event, etc.

### Flight safety reports

Each report can be associated to a flight. If it is, the flight information will be displayed on the top part of the report, along with the crew names and user types.

All other report information is displayed below and only the safety manager or other, higher level managers can edit or delete the stored information.

Additionally, the person writing the report or any manager can comment on the report and upload files as needed that will be attached to the existing report.
