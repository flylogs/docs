# ICAO 8951 Risk Matrix

### When Is the Risk Matrix Used?

The ICAO 8951 risk matrix is applied when **closing or publishing a safety report**. During this process, the system will prompt the safety manager to:

* Select the **initial risk severity**
* Select the **initial risk probability**
* Define **mitigation actions or corrective measures**
* (Optionally) Select the **mitigated risk severity** and **probability**

Once saved, a visual risk matrix will be automatically generated and attached to the report for reference.

***

### How to Use the Risk Matrix

1. **Navigate to a safety report**\
   Open any report from the Safety menu that is ready to be closed or published.
2. **Select risk values**\
   Under the "Risk Assessment" section, choose:
   * **Risk Severity**: Negligible, Marginal, Critical, Hazardous, Catastrophic
   * **Risk Probability**: Remote, Improbable, Possible, Probable, Likely
3. **Enter corrective actions**\
   Clearly describe any actions taken to mitigate the risk.
4. **(Optional) Define mitigated risk**\
   If actions were effective, update the post-mitigation severity and probability.
5. **Save and close the report**\
   A dynamic matrix will be displayed on the report, showing both initial and mitigated risk levels.

### Understanding the Matrix

The matrix follows the ICAO 8951 standard, with **severity** on one axis and **probability** on the other. The resulting cell is color-coded to indicate the risk level:

* 🟩 Green: Low risk
* 🟨 Yellow: Medium risk
* 🟥 Red: High risk

Both **initial** and **mitigated** risk levels are shown when available.

### Why It Matters

The ICAO risk matrix helps:

* Standardize risk assessment across all reports
* Improve visibility for management decisions
* Ensure compliance with ICAO safety management practices
