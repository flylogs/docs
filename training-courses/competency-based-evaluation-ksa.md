# Competency-Based Evaluation (KSA)



Flylogs Trainings supports **competency-based student evaluation (KSA)** through configurable learning objectives linked directly to lessons. This allows instructors and training managers to assess each student consistently against predefined objectives, in addition to tracking attendance.

***

### Overview

With this feature, training managers can:

* Define **Learning Objectives (KSA / competency items)** per lesson
* Enable or disable competency-based evaluation at training level
* Allow instructors or training managers to:
  * Record student attendance
  * Evaluate students **per learning objective**
  * Add remarks and corrective measures when required

This ensures traceability between **training content**, **lesson delivery**, and **student performance**.

***

### 1. Enabling Learning Objectives for a Training

Learning Objectives are enabled at the **training level**.

1. Open an **ONSITE** or **REMOTE** training
2. Click **Edit Training**
3. Enable the option **“Enable Learning Objectives in lessons”**

Once enabled, all lessons within this training can store and use learning objectives for student evaluation.

### 2. Defining Learning Objectives per Lesson

Each lesson can have its own set of learning objectives.

1. Open a lesson
2. Go to the **Objectives** tab
3. Add one or more learning objectives as needed

Learning objectives typically reference:

* Syllabus or regulatory items
* Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA)
* Internal training standards

These objectives will later be used during student evaluation.

### 3. Attendance and Student Evaluation During the Lesson

When a lesson is scheduled and delivered:

* The **assigned teacher** or **any training manager** can:
  * Mark student attendance
  * Evaluate each attending student

From the attendance view, an **Evaluate** button is available for each student.

### 4. Evaluating Students per Learning Objective

When evaluating a student:

* All learning objectives defined for the lesson are displayed
* Each objective can be evaluated individually (e.g. Standard / Above / Below)
* The evaluator can add:
  * **Remarks**
  * **Corrective measures**, if required

This allows a clear, objective-by-objective assessment of student performance for that specific lesson.<br>
