# Teacher tools

Once a class or exam is scheduled, the assigned teacher and students get access to the scheduled event page details. Additionally, the selected teacher and all company managers, can add some extra content to the event, communicate with students and rate them. \
\
**This is what teachers can do:**

**In regular lessons:**

* Add documents or files for the class
* Comment on and answer students' questions
* View and update the student list
* Record class attendance and evaluate student performance, add remarks and corrective measures if needed.

**In exams:**

* Record attendance
* View and update the student list
* Enter exam grades
* Comment on and answer students' questions

Once attendance or exam results are recorded, they are stored in each student's training record. Managers can then access all attendance and exam records, along with a summary showing the percentage of attendance for the entire training program or per subject.

This information is also available to the student and is included in full detail in the training report that Flylogs creates for each student.
