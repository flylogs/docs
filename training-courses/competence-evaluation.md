# Competence evaluation

Any training can be set to have certain competencies to be evaluated. You can activate this feature from the Training > Edit page.&#x20;

Check the Evaluate based on Competencies and create the competencies you need. By default **Knowledge**, **Skills** and **Attitude** should appear already created, you can edit or delete these.

Once the competencies are created and you click on SAVE training changes, your FIs evaluating flight exercises will have the option to evaluate any of the competencies you just created.

Evaluation of the competencies is optional and is done the same way you evaluate any other exercise in the flight mission.

Every evaluated competence is stored in the student profile so you can see a summary of every competence evaluated for the student and also for the whole training. Thanks to this, you can easily identify training deficiency patters for pilot groups or for the whole training.
