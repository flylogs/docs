# Edit a training

### Training types

Flylogs allows you to create 3 types of trainings: Onsite trainings, Online trainings and Distance learning trainings.

Onsite and Online trainings can be used when the teachers them-selfs will be teaching directly to the students. The teachers will evaluate students directly.  In this trainings, assistance and exam results are entered by the teachers of each subject.

On the other hand, distance learning allows you to create 100% online training, with online progress checks that allow the student to complete the training by him self. Distance learning checks that the student spends the required amount of time on each content and requires the student to pass the online knowledge assessments that you may publish inside each lesson or subject.

Online knowledge assessments can be multiple choice questions, allowing you to upload question attachments and publishing as many answer options as you wish.

These questions can be managed directly by you, or your teachers and can be easily downloaded and imported from a spreadsheet.

### Training management

Training management has been designed to be easy for anybody with little to none technical knowledge.

Main training options appear first: Activate/deactivate training, enable flight training, make mandatory to pass a lesson before continuing to the next one...

Flylogs even gives you the option to set a global start/end date for the training, this can also be set per student.
