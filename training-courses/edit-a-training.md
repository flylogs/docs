* Activate/deactivate the training, and method of flight mission evaluation,
* Activate flight missions,&#x20;
* Training availability and validity dates for expiration,

* and subjects.

All this training settings can be modified at any time and will change the settings for all trainees signed up in the course.

### Flight Missions

Activating the Flight training checkbox, you will have the option to create a list of flight missions with exercises for the current training course. \
Also, when enabling Flight training this box shown below will appear.\
This additional box, allows you to select the exercise grading scale, require student signature of debriefings and it will also give you the option to activate the competence evaluation system.

### Training availability and validity

**Training availability** sets a timeframe when the training course will be open to students enrolled in the course. You can define either the start date or the end date or both.

**Training validity** defines until when the training endorsement is valid (after training completion). It works like an expiration period for the training endorsement in the pilot profile page.
