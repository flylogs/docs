# Edit a training

Training management has been designed to be easy for anybody with little to none technical knowledge.

Main options in the training settings include the following:

* Name of training
* Type of training, (Onsite, remote or distance learning)
* Activate/deactivate the training, and method of flight mission evaluation,
* Activate flight missions,&#x20;
* Training availability and validity dates for expiration,
* Student announcements,
* Training description and syllabus details,
* and subjects.

All this training settings can be modified at any time and will change the settings for all trainees signed up in the course.

### Flight Missions

Activating the Flight training checkbox, you will have the option to create a list of flight missions with exercises for the current training course.

### Training availability and validity

**Training availability** sets a timeframe when the training course will be open to students enrolled in the course. You can define either the start date or the end date or both.

**Training validity** defines until when the training endorsement is valid (after training completion). It works like an expiration period for the training endorsement in the pilot profile page.
