# Edit a training

Training management has been designed to be easy for anybody with little to none technical knowledge.

Main training options appear first: Activate/deactivate training, enable flight training, make mandatory to pass a lesson before continuing to the next one...

Flylogs even gives you the option to set a global start/end date for the training, this can also be set per student.
