* Activate/deactivate the training, and method of flight mission evaluation,
* Activate flight missions,&#x20;
* Training availability and validity dates for expiration,

* and subjects.

All this training settings can be modified at any time and will change the settings for all trainees signed up in the course.

### Training availability and validity

**Training availability** stands for the date range in between the training course will be open to the students to be studied.

**Training validity**, refers to the time the training endorsement is valid to the user after finishing the training. It works like an expiration period for the training endorsement in the pilot profile page.
