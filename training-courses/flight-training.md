# Flight Training

If you have activated the Flight Training Missions checkbox in your training edit page, you will have now an additional tab in the main training page.

Once you have created the flight missions for your training, you will be prompted to enter the mission results for each student when creating a flight.

### Edit Flight missions

The flight missions are categorized by flight rules, flight type and time. They can be ordered as you need to by just dragging the missions up and down.

To create a new mission, just click on the **+ New Mission** button. If you chose to edit an existing one, the same form will pop but it will be populated with the existing mission data.

A third option exists to Copy an existing mission, when clicking the COPY button, a new copy of the original mission will be created at the end of the missions list.

The form to create/edit flight missions is really straight forward and allows you to manage the basic information about the mission on the left, and  you can organize all the required mission exercises on the right side.

### Evaluate Flight missions

> When adding a flight, if both the Pilot-In-Command (PIC) and Second-In-Command (SIC) are enrolled in any training, you will see boxes that allow you to select which exercises they performed on that particular flight. This feature enables you to evaluate each pilot individually.

After the flight is confirmed, the flight time will be added to the training reports of both pilots and included in their training flight time.

#### Multiple missions

You can have multiple missions per flight, and multiple flights for each mission. This can be done for any of the crew members of the flight.

Single flight, multiple missions example:

Also, you can have the same mission, repeated as many times as needed in following flights. In this case, all repetitions will appear in the training report of the pilot:
