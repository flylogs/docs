# Training basics

### Training types

Flylogs has 3 types of trainings you can create.

* **Onsite training**\
  Allows you and teachers to keep track of lessons, including class contents, attendance and exam results. Lessons are in physical locations that can be reserved.
* **Remote training**\
  Allows you and teachers to keep track of lessons, including class contents, attendance and exam results. Lessons are face to face online.
* **Distance learning**\
  Students use online content and self assessment tools to study and complete each lesson in their own time. You can assign a supervisor that will support the student in their Distance Learning. The time each student spends studying will be tracked.

### Competency-Based Evaluation (KSA)

Flylogs Trainings provides functionality to support **Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA)** in accordance with EASA principles, enabling the structured assessment of **Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes (KSA)**&#x61;gainst predefined **learning objectives** at lesson level.

The system ensures that:

* Training objectives are defined in advance
* Assessments are conducted against observable criteria
* Records are traceable to the specific lesson, instructor, and student
* Corrective actions can be documented where performance is below standard

***

### Scope and Applicability

This functionality applies to:

* **ONSITE** and **REMOTE** theoretical or practical training
* Lessons delivered under CBTA or traditional training frameworks
*   Evaluations performed by:

    * Assigned instructors
    * Training managers with appropriate permissions

### Training life cycle and expirations

You can enroll students into trainings individually, or enroll an entire pilot group at once.

After enrollment, you can assign a training tutor to each student and set a **“finish before”** date by which the student must complete the training.

You can also define an **expiration date** for the resulting training qualification endorsement. Once a student completes the training, the endorsement will appear in their endorsement list for the defined validity period.

When the endorsement expires, it is automatically marked as expired and removed. The student will need to complete the training again to regain the endorsement.

### Training templates

When you click the **CREATE NEW TRAINING BUTTON**, a wizard window will open asking you for the basic information about the course.

You can create a brand new training, copy an existing one, or use one of the available templates.

Flylogs offers pre built templates for the EASA PPL and ATPL programs. This templates come directly from the published training requirements and learning objectives existing in the respective EASA-FCL parts.

### Training reports

These are the reports you will have for each one of your trainings:

* **Students report**\
  This report displays all students for each one of your training courses. It includes basic student info, training progress, attendance %, flight training progress and last flight date.
* **Training Audit**\
  This page is similar to the Student report, but it is more focused into the ground school, including subject results and attendance records of all exams and lessons for each one of the students.
* **Teachers report**\
  The teachers report displays the amount of lessons and time spent by each teacher for a given training and date range.
* **Analytics**\
  This last page in the trainings tab, shows the amount of students that are still enrolled in the training and the phase of flight they are in. It also ranks the most repeated and failed flight missions in beautiful charts. This gives you an insight to understand and improve the training on those missions that your students find the hardest.
