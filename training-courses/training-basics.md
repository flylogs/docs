### Training types

Flylogs has 3 types of trainings you can create.

* **Onsite training**\
  Allows you and teachers to keep track of lessons, including class contents, attendance and exam results. Lessons are in physical locations that can be reserved.
* **Remote training**\
  Allows you and teachers to keep track of lessons, including class contents, attendance and exam results. Lessons are face to face online.
* **Distance learning**\
  Students use online content and self assessment tools to study and complete each lesson in their own time. You can assign a supervisor that will support the student in their Distance Learning. The time each student spends studying will be tracked.

### Training templates

When you click the **CREATE NEW TRAINING BUTTON**, a wizard window will open asking you for the basic information about the course.

You can create a brand new training, or copy an existing one, or use one of the available templates.

Flylogs also offers pre built templates for the EASA PPL and ATPL programs. This templates come directly from the published training requirements and learning objectives existing in the respective FCL parts.

### Training reports

These are the reports you will have for each one of your trainings:

* **Students report**\
  This report displays all students for each one of your training courses. It displays along with basic student info, the training progress, attendance %, flight training and last flight date.
* **Training Audit**\
  This page is similar to the Student report, but goes into more depth allowing you to see subject by subject the attendance % and results of all exams for each one of the students enrolled in the selected training.
* **Teachers report**\
  The teachers report allows you to audit the amount of lessons and time spent by each teacher for a given training and date range.
* **Analytics**\
  This last page in the trainings tab, allows you to visually see the amount of students that are still enrolled in the training and the phase of flight they are in. It also ranks the most repeated and failed flight missions, so you can improve the focus on those missions that your students find the hardest.
