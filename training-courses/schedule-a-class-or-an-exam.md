# Schedule a class or an exam

Flylogs gives you the tools for the whole training cycle, and part of that cycle are the daily lessons that are given to students.

Flylogs allows you to schedule this classes, select the teacher and the students and notify everybody at the same time.

The process is simple and fast, and the teacher has instant access to the scheduled class management to upload the contents that he/she thinks may be appropriate.

The students at the same time, have access to the scheduled lesson. They can read the content of the class, the published description and download the documents the teacher uploaded.

There is also a comment box, which can be enabled or disabled, but which could be very useful for questions that the students may have.

### Student exam results and attendance records

As part of the scheduled lesson management, the teacher or any manager, can access to the class, and mark the students that attended the class.

This records are stored in the student's academic profile as part of the training progress.
