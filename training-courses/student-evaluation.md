# Student evaluation

Flylogs provides a flexible and comprehensive student evaluation system for ground and flight training, allowing instructors to assess student performance using different grading scales and additional competency metrics.

**Evaluation Scales**

Flight training can be evaluated using one of the following three grading systems:

1. **Standard-Based**: Below STD, STD, Above STD
2. **Numerical Scale**: 1 to 5 grading system
3. **NICE Grading**: A structured evaluation method

**Additional Evaluation Features**

Once an evaluation type is selected, instructors can enable:

* **KSA (Knowledge, Skills, Attitude) Competency Evaluations**
  * Allows the creation of specific activities to assess different competencies for each student.
* **Performance Metrics**
  * Standardized criteria applicable across all training sessions, enabling consistent evaluation of student attributes such as attitude, punctuality, and effort.

### **Knowledge evaluation**

Flylogs offers two types of knowledge evaluation exams:

1. **On-Site or Remote Exams**
   * These are structured training exams conducted as part of the Flylogs training program. They can be integrated into the training syllabus and scheduled for a specific date.
   * Exams are managed similarly to classes, allowing you to assign a location, instructor, and schedule.
   * Once the exam takes place, the instructor or a training manager can mark attendance and record grades.
2. **Distance Training Evaluations**
   * Distance training programs require students to complete self-evaluation tests after each content unit.
   * These online assessments are available in Flylogs and can be taken by students at their convenience.
   * While online evaluations are available for all training types, they are mandatory for distance training, ensuring continuous assessment after each lesson or subject.

### **Flight training evaluation**

On each flight, Flylogs will check for training enrollments for both PIC and SIC. You will be able to evaluate any of the crew members and introduce as many flight missions as necessary. On each of the performed flight missions, the performance metrics will be there to be evaluated as neccesary.

**Training Records & Visualization**

All evaluations are securely stored in the student's training record and displayed in intuitive charts. These visual representations help instructors quickly identify strengths and areas for improvement, making it easier to track student progress and enhance training effectiveness.

Once teachers introduce exam results, these are stored in the student syllabus and available for all training managers, as well as the student:

### Flight debriefing

Additionally, you can require SIC pilots or students to sign the flight mission results as well as any debriefing remarks written by the PIC. You may activate this option as as an email sumary to be sent to all crew members upon flight confirmation.
